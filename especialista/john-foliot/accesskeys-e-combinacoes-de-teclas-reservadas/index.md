Prologue
--------

Back in the early 2000′s,
my colleague and friend [Derek Featherstone](http://simplyaccessible.com/)
and I launched a joint consultancy group in Ottawa,
Canada that focused on the issues of on-line accessibility,
and the emergent techniques and requirements of this (at the time) new aspect of web development.
Derek and I wrapped up WATS.ca somewhere around 2006 as we moved on to other projects,
but we both remain active in the field today.

We jointly published a number of articles on our web-site that often became go-to references then,
and it seems a shame that they be lost to the vagaries of time;
the original site long since gone.
I have created an Archive section of this site to preserve those postings,
and the following article from that time is one such.
Please note that some of the information in this or other similar articles may be dated,
or superseded by events in time:
I am making no attempt to update these articles and am simply posting them as they existed when they were first written.

-   [The Future of Accesskeys](//john.foliot.ca/the-future-of-accesskeys/)

In a non-scientific study conducted in the summer of 2002, we researched the
availability of available Accesskeys which had not already been reserved by
various other software technologies which might be employed by various users.
The results indicated a real problem in that most ALT + \_\_ keystroke
combinations (assuming the Windows operating platform) have already been
reserved by one type of application or another.

Given that at this writing there are few if any available ALT + \_\_ keystrokes
left, and conceding that built in or assigned keystroke combinations inherent in
software applications should take precedence for the end user, WATS.ca continues
to advocate that the ACCESSKEY element/attribute, while a good idea in
principle, is fraught with so many potential problems that we have abandoned
using them in the interest of true inter-operability.

While it would be presumptuous of us to declare this table “complete” it *does*
illustrate the number of keystroke combinations which would conflict with
implementation of the ACCESSKEY functionality introduced in HTML 4.0. Errors,
omissions or inclusions are gratefully appreciated and will be added to this
page upon receipt.

We have included Opera for reference only. We are aware that Opera doesn’t use
the ALT + \_ keystroke to invoke accesskeys. We also acknowledge that this
appears Windows-centric and that other Operating Systems may invoke alternative
modifier kyes to access the designated hot-key.

Addendum: A big thanks goes out to Mikko Rantalainen
(<mikko.rantalainen@peda.net>) for providing the following information regarding
internationalization, specifically Finnish/Swedish localizations:

-   Default Internet Explorer for Finnish localization has menu bar accelerators
    for T, M, N, S, K and O and address bar accelerator E.
-   In addition, shortcuts with ‘=’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘\[‘, ‘\]’, ‘/’, ”, ‘;’ and ‘:’
    require using shift or AltGr with Finnish/Swedish (and most other European)
    keyboard layouts so those cannot be used with just ALT. (For example, to
    type ‘\[‘ I have to press AltGr+8. So “ALT+\[” requires me to press
    Alt+AltGr+8 which seldom works as expected. If you accept this kind of
    shortcuts you might as well add “AltGr+µ” as it’s equally easy to
    type (Alt+AltGr+M) with my Finnish layout keyboard).
-   Non-numeric keys that can be used without any modifier key in
    Finnish/Swedish keyboard layout are: + ‘ – . , &lt; § and letters å ä ö
    \[written in UTF-8\]
