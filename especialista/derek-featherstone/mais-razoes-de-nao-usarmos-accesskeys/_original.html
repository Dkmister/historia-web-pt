  <h2>Prologue</h2>
  <p>Back in the early 2000′s, my colleague and friend <a href="http://simplyaccessible.com/">Derek Featherstone</a>    and I launched a joint consultancy group in Ottawa, Canada that focused on the
    issues of on-line accessibility, and the emergent techniques and requirements
    of this (at the time) new aspect of web development. Derek and I wrapped up WATS.ca
    somewhere around 2006 as we moved on to other projects, but we both remain active
    in the field today.</p>
  <p>We jointly published a number of articles on our web-site that often became go-to
    references then, and it seems a shame that they be lost to the vagaries of time;
    the original site long since gone. I have created an Archive section of this
    site to preserve those postings, and the following article from that time is
    one such. Please note that some of the information in this or other similar articles
    may be dated, or superseded by events in time: I am making no attempt to update
    these articles and am simply posting them as they existed when they were first
    written.</p>

  </ul>
</div>
<p>The topic of accesskeys regularly appears on mailing lists, forums, and other arenas.
  Developers ask what the concensus is, and the answer is — there isn’t one. We believe
  that the functionality accesskeys provide is worthwhile, but their implementation
  and standardization leave something to be desired.</p>
<h2>Accesskeys</h2>
<p>In general, HTML defined accesskeys are being used to provide the ability to quickly
  invoke the links in a site that go to specific destinations including such examples
  as a search page, a contact page or the home page of a site. In some cases they
  are being used to provide an alternative mechanism to “skip navigation” or “skip
  to content”. In principle, we agree that this functionality is a worthwhile end
  goal as it has the potential to make the web more usable for all.</p>
<h2>The Ideal Solution</h2>
<p>We also firmly believe there have to be a number of conditions for accesskeys to
  be not only useful, but successfully implemented on a large scale. These include:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Standardized implementation across sites</dt>
  <dd>The reason behind this is obvious. If it isn’t standardized, then users will have
    to learn different accesskeys on each site they visit. Many sites and authors
    have suggested different standards, with the most widely referenced being that
    at <a href="//clagnut.com/accessibility" class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">Clagnut</a>    and <a href="//www.diveintoaccessibility.org/accessibility_statement.html">DiveIntoAccessibility.org</a>    that use numbers for Accesskeys, similar to that <a href="//www.e-envoy.gov.uk/Resources/WebHandbookIndex1Article/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4000092&amp;chk=XHiT3L"
      class="broken_link" rel="nofollow">recommended by the Government in the UK</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Conflict resolution</dt>
  <dd>In cases where a conflict exists between an HTML defined Accesskey and a built
    in keyboard binding for a given User Agent or a user-defined keyboard binding
    in a user agent, the HTML defined Accesskey <strong>must not</strong> override
    the User Agent’s behaviour. If an HTML defined accesskey were to take precedence
    over a User Agent keyboard binding, critical functionality could be lost, potentially
    leaving the user confused, or unable to complete tasks.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Standardization</h2>
<p>Standardization itself is not so much of a problem as is conflict resolution. Thankfully,
  many developers have come to this realization, and have worked toward standardizing
  accesskeys, and an emerging trend is to use the digits 0 though 9, instead of letters.</p>
<h3>The Problem with Letters and Learned Behaviours</h3>
<p>The problem with letters is obvious – HTML defined accesskeys appear to conflict
  with User Agent defined keyboard bindings to menus and other functionality.</p>
<p>In these cases of apparent conflict, the HTML defined accesskey can be invoked differently
  than the User Agent menus (see: relevant discussion on the <a href="//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2003AprJun/0612.html">WAI list</a>,
  and on the <a href="//webaim.org/discussion/mail_message.php?id=2270">WebAIM list</a>)</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it will be extremely difficult to teach new keystroke
  behaviour to users, and there is no easy way to determine which keystroke method
  to use as there is generally no method for determining the accesskeys on a site
  when you first arrive at it (hence the reason many sites now use Alt-0 to display
  their accessibility statement and list of accesskeys, and others are using different
  methods to display the accesskeys inline within the document.)</p>
<h3>The Problem with Symbols</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2002, <a href="//john.foliot.ca/accesskeys-and-reserved-keystroke-combinations/">we collected as much information as we could</a>  regarding which keystroke combinations were “reserved” in user agents and assistive
  devices.</p>
<p>There remained some symbols available, but symbols are problematic, especially when
  dealing with International keyboards layouts.
</p>
<h3 id="numwineyes">The Problem with Numbers</h3>
<p>Numbers seem to be a reasonable alternative, and a strategy many are now using. There
  is however, a catch.</p>
<p>Current and previous versions of WindowEyes software use Alt+0 through Alt+9 to reference
  “User-defined windows” that outline specific areas of the screen. From the WindowEyes
  User Manual at <a href="//www.gwmicro.com/wemanual/section4_2.htm" class="broken_link"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.gwmicro.com/wemanual/section4_2.htm</a> (framebuster
  script means we can’t link directly to that page, so look for section 4.2 in the
  contents frame on the left).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.gwmicro.com/wemanual/section4_2.htm">
  <p>Window-Eyes has two kinds of windows, standard and hyperactive. Standard user windows
    are for reading portions of the display screen while ignoring other portions.
    They can be set to any size, from one character to the entire display screen.
    You can read the contents of any of the first twenty standard windows with the
    press of a hot key. Windows 0 through 9 can be read with ALT-0 through ALT-9.
    Windows 10 through 19 have their hot keys undefined by default. Any of the 50
    standard windows can be read with the Any Window hot key, undefined in the default
    Window-Eyes speaking environment. Though fifty standard user windows are available,
    few speech-access users ever need to use all, or even most of them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users using WindowEyes will not have access to numeric accesskeys. Many will argue
  that defining the accesskeys with numbers for everyone else will be of use, as
  long as defining them doesn’t override any expected behaviour of user agent, or
  assistive technology such as WindowEyes. This seems reasonable, but certainly not
  universal, and we believe that a universal solution would be preferable.</p>
<h3 id="numopera">The Problem with Opera and Numbers</h3>
<p>Actually, there appears to be more than one catch when using numeric accesskeys.
  While Opera supports numeric accesskeys, the mechanism to activate them differs
  from activating letter assigned accesskeys. In Opera, to activate a letter accesskey,
  you hold down Shift + Esc + letter. When using numbers on the other hand, you must
  press Shift + Esc, let go, and then press the number.</p>
<p>This becomes more problematic as the number keys also have functionality within Opera
  including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number 0: Zoom in 10%</li>
  <li>Number 9: Zoom out 10%</li>
  <li>Number 8: Zoom in 100%</li>
  <li>Number 7: Zoom out 100%</li>
  <li>Number 6: Restore to 100%</li>
  <li>Number 3: Cycle through frames on a page</li>
  <li>Number 2: Cycle to next page</li>
  <li>Number 1: Cycle to previous page</li>
  <li>Number 4: Minimize active Page</li>
  <li>Number 5: Switch between restored and maximized page</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that if you don’t press the number soon enough after you’ve pressed and
  released Shift + Esc, you will invoke the default number behaviour instead of the
  element to which the accesskey is assigned. We haven’t gone to the point of measuring
  what factors determine how much delay is given between the keystrokes before the
  behaviour reverts to the default instead of the accesskey. Perhaps some day.</p>
<h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>
<p>The W3C User Agent Guidelines don’t specifically spell out what should happen in
  cases of conflict between locally/document defined keyboard bindings and user agent/OS
  keyboard bindings. However, it seems logical that a document that includes “Guideline
  11. Allow configuration and customization”, would suggest that such customization
  is done at the User Agent level, and that these settings would override the settings
  of the individual document. We already have this case with user defined stylesheets.</p>
<p>In any case, we should expect that the user agent settings would override anything
  that the author puts in place, because the user agent is presumably configured
  by the end user.</p>
<p>It appears that this is not the case in certain instances.</p>
<h3>Mozilla and Conflicts with Extensions</h3>
<p><strong>Updated April 9, 2004</strong>: <a href="//www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>  and other Gecko based user agents such as
  <a href="//www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">FireFox</a> have the advantage of
  being customizable through extensions that are written by third parties. One of
  the more popular is the <a href="//extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info.php/rssreaderpanel">RSS Reader Panel</a>.
  When installed it displays a list of RSS Bookmarks in the Mozilla sidebar, along
  with a list of items in the RSS feed. The RSS Reader Panel is toggled on and off
  using the ALT + R keystroke (on a PC). We recently experienced that this was overridden
  by accesskeys that were author defined in a page we were browsing. What made this
  more confusing was the fact that the accesskeys were not visibly identified on
  the page. The accesskey simply hijacked the keystroke.</p>
<p>It is foreseeable that many more conflicts are possible as the number of third party
  extensions increases. Again, the question arises – in cases of conflict, who wins?
  Clearly we don’t want accesskeys to override behaviours of the user agent.</p>
<h3>WindowEyes, IE, and ALT + S</h3>
<p>WindowEyes defines the keystroke ALT + S as a function that reads that status bar.
  Including S in your list of accesskeys will not work with current versions of WindowEyes.</p>
<h3>IE and ALT + D</h3>
<p>Internet Explorer binds the keystroke ALT+D to the address bar. An HTML defined accesskey
  for the letter D overrides the keyboard binding to the address bar, and therefore
  disables that critical keyboard shortcut for IE users. This is the perfect example
  of where accesskeys can go wrong, as it is the exact opposite of what we believe
  should happen in terms of conflict resolution.</p>
<p>A note on International versions of IE — we installed and tested the latest version
  of IE in other languages (Spanish and Italian) wondering if the same problem might
  occur, but with different letters. Interestingly enough, the ALT + D combination
  was used to focus on the address bar as well simply because the letter d was in
  the translated version of “Address” in each of the languages we tested. If you
  have another version of IE in a different language that uses a key other than D
  to focus on the address bar, please let us know so that we can update our references.</p>
<p>JAWS screen reading software absolutely relies on keystrokes, as does WindowEyes.
  These screen readers run “on top of” the other software on the users computer,
  and in most cases for the web, on top of Microsoft Internet Explorer. Further,
  IBM’s HomePageReader utilizes IE’s rendering engine to read web pages. It too,
  relies heavily on keystrokes to function. In these cases where keystrokes are vital,
  the potential for confusion and problems is greater.</p>
<p>These (admittedly obscure) cases show disparity within a single browser where the
  user agent recovers nicely on conflict for certain key bindings and in others it
  (quite unexpectedly) overrides default behaviour. Without clear concensus from
  the browser makers on conflict resolution and which keyboard binding should take
  priority, implementing accesskeys successfully becomes even more difficult. User
  preferences should take precedence over author preference. Certainly the possibility
  exists that there are other such conflicts that may exist in different user agents/adaptive
  technology combinations.</p>
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
<p>We want to make sure we are clear on one thing. We like the concept behind accesskeys,
  we just believe there is too much wiggle room, even though others have recommended
  “standards”. The problem is that it still isn’t standard. We did a
  <a href="//www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=UK+Government+Accesskeys+Standards">search for UK Government Accesskeys standards</a>  and found sites that claimed to be following the standards using numeric accesskeys,
  but then went on to declare additional accesskeys that included many letters, and
  in some cases included S and D – unfortunate choices given the above conflicts.</p>
<p>We do support the idea, but believe we all need a different and more robust way to
  implement the same functionality.</p>
