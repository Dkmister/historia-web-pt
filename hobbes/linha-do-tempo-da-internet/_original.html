   Sites = Number of web servers (one host may have multiple sites by using different
           domains or port numbers)

   Notes on causes of signifant increases/drops:
   - Feb'09 increase likely due to 20M new Chinese sites served by qq.com
   - Aug'09 drop likely due to domain expiry at The Planet, including 5M .pl domains
     served from one IP alleged to be a linkfarm
   - Jan'10 drop likely due to qq.com blogs no longer being publically listed
   - Jul-Aug'12 drop caused by removal of several wildcard hostnames with similar content
   - Sep'12 drop caused by large network of linkfarmed domains disappearing from under the .com TLD
   - Nov'14-Jan'15 drop largely caused by parked websites, with half attributed to a single IP ceasing to host them

<DL>
<DT>1. How do I get Hobbes' Internet Timeline?
<DD>The Timeline is archived at <A HREF="http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/">http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/</A>.
   There are no authorized mirrors for the Timeline.
<p>
<DT>2. Is the Timeline available in other languages or editions?

  If you are interested in translating to another language or format, email me first
<p>
<DT>3. Can I re-print the Timeline or use parts of it for ... ?
<DD>Drop me an email.  The answer is most likely (though don't assume) 'yes'
   for non-profit use, and 'maybe' for for-profit; but to be sure you are not
   going to break any copyright laws, drop me an email and wait for a reply.
   Also, please note that I get a bunch of requests with improperly formatted
   return email addresses.  If you don't hear from me in a week (typical turn
   around is &lt; 1 hour), check your header and email again.  BTW, don't
   forget to tell me who you are, your affiliation and how you plans to use
   the Timeline; anonymous copyright requests will not be granted.
